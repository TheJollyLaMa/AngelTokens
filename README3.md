require makes it so that the function will throw an error and stop executing if some condition is not true:
Thus require is quite useful for verifying certain conditions that must be true before running a function.


function sayHiToVitalik(string memory _name) public returns (string memory) {
  // Compares if _name equals "Vitalik". Throws an error and exits if not true.
  // (Side note: Solidity doesn't have native string comparison, so we
  // compare their keccak256 hashes to see if the strings are equal)
  require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_name)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Vitalik")));
  // If it's true, proceed with the function:
  return "Hi!";
}
