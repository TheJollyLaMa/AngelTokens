    <h1>Mission:</h1>
        The Earthlings are in need of assistance.  They all have riches they sit on, but due to the Curse of Babel,
        they have lost the way of comfort and harmony.  They are naturally connected, but have forgetten their connection.
        Communication has become noisy and incoherent. Trust is at an all time low.  They have forgotten how to enjoy even
        the simplest things - like clean water and fresh air, the matter of Gravity, and Fire. They have forgetten the ways
        to enjoy them. They have forgotten their infinite dynamic nature! And worse still, they have forgetten why they
        should even endeavor at all.  Fear and mistrust are rampant, even among such abundance!
    </p>    
    <p>
        We believe, with your help, <em>Angels</em>, and the help of <img height="55px" src="./public/AT_ETH_ENS_Logo.gif">
        we can make the world a better place.  We know that you remember how
        to use the Ether <img height="35px" src="./public/ethereum.jpg"> from a past life!  We also know that you are sitting on a pile of riches! Yes,
        You! We all do something.  And we're all doing it with someone and for someone.  But because of the Curse of Babel, no
        one can read the road signs so no one knows where to go or how to get there .  They all just spend their days griping
        and crumbling about at each other incoherently in general dis-ease. Listen to me....  It's even starting to overcome The Jolly LaMa! We
        better hurry!
    <p/>
    <p>
        Let's get connected!  Use your knowledge of Ethereum to Manifest Angel Tokens and fund an entrepreneurial endeavor today!
        Here's a huge bag of Angel Tokens.  They each come minted with certain information like:  a unit product, a cost, a return
        dividend, a status of execution, a mint date, an issue number - so they are all trackable - listen you don't want just
        anybody getting these things!  They are powerful! - Right you already know.  I knew you were perfect for the job.  You're
        just such an Angel!   
    </p>     
    <p>
        Now, whenever you want to mint tokens for an endeavor, just push your Angel Token Specifications into your Visual Portal
        with those meaty sausages at the end of your wobbly appendages and make sure you have a plan on how to make your tokens worth something!  
        Your an Angel, for Christ's sake - Now start acting like one!  Make sure you can teleport the product to the Sprite's
        destination, and make sure the Sprite giving alms understands that's ALL THIS IS!  Dont let them get confused.  If the
        product cant get past the Filters caused by the Curse of Babel, IT's NOT YOUR FAULT ANGEL! It's just part of the business
        of manifesting in troubling times!
    </p>
    <p> Recap:
            Your Mission, should you choose to accept, is to mint Angel tokens that will better the lives of your neighbors!  Whatever
            it is you know how to create or produce - or if you want to help a neighbor create and produce, Better Yet!  Sometimes,
            it's best just to help a neighbor collect and count their alms! They'll have to help you define an endeavor, of course.
            better get to it! Remember - be friendly and sustainable.  No sense in manifesting anything that would kill the planet
            you've gotten it from! Find something cheap, easy and useful to produce, factor the costs, and find 1000 neighbors who think they would enjoy that deal!
    </p>
    <p>
    Now, Go Be an Angel! Check out the README2.md to create a portal through Heaven into the AngelToken Manifestation Room on your own machine - that's         where new tokens are minted upon request from Angels deploying on Endeavors.

   <p>P.S. - Shameless plug: If you're in the U.S. and fresh roasted coffee is your thing, head on over to <a href="https://www.caffeinelamanna.com/#!/AngelsRoom">
    Caffeine LaManna</a> to be a Sweet Sprite and check out <img height="55px" src="./public/css/tokenfront.png"> Caffeine LaManna's Angel Token
    <img height="55px" src="./public/css/tokenfront.png"> - The first one EVER to be manifested on Earth! It wasn't easy to summon up- but once you get the right mix and the right Sprites around, it comes naturally! The general plan would be to dedicate a few Full Roast weeks toward deleveraging the startup costs (roaster, webdev, insurance).  So basically a crowdfund!  It's a pretty lean way of bettering the lives of those around you as well as your own through tight knit circles of entrepreneurial people sharing the skills they've perfected and inherited. Plus, you get a sweet little token viewable from anywhere in the world on a decentralized database and held in your own encrypted wallet to memorialize your involvment!
</p>
<p>Shameful P.P.S - There isnt actually an Angel Token yet though it's very close to Earth. Therefore there isnt actually a Caffeine LaManna Token yet.  Jolly made a project too big for his bhuddi and he's looking for a few spiritually capable beings to help it develop into a healthy friend to all!  Can any of you angels out there help make the dream a reality? We could change the coffee buttons to fund any endeavor you'd like.  (Be Kind! Think Twice! And do it for Greta!)</p>

<p>If you need any help setting up the development environment, just create an issue and/or email me j@caffeinelamanna.com - I guess we'll need a set of instructions to better facilitate collaboration. Also, if anybody reading this doesn't EVER put on the coder's hat, but you have a great idea of how to assist or how the project could assist you, I'd like to hear that just as well.</p>

 do it all again for each endeavor until Earth is healed and situated properly in the cosmos again!
    - every startup endeavor has its Angels and its Sprites
    - an Angel is someone who mints tokens to endeavor to make life better for humanity
    - a sprite is someone who supports an Angel's endeavor
    - All Angels are Sprites. Not every Sprite is an Angel - but Hey! At least they give!
    - An Angel Cup shows the Angel Tokens an Angel has minted when searchign for sprites to fuel an endeaver
    - A Sprite wallet shows the alms (units of different Angel Tokens) being fueled by a Sprite
