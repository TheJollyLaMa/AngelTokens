original angel token contract gets contaminated or fragmented

brainstorm:

      you could have a backup printed master list
      you could hold the manifested tokens on a decentralized website
        every manifestation is pushed to that website first and then transferred to the holder
        that would leave decentralized breadcrumbs to compare quality to in the event of a catastrophe
        each breadcrumb would hold the standard even though completely different from each otherwise


but wait! the only tokens that really matter are this rounds tokens anyway!
Since all angels only manifest on a short term, projected, and well directed endeavor,
risk is inherently mitigated!  i.e., if the tokens vanish, the worst thing that happens is
nobody gets their share of next round!  They still got their product.

indeed, the real danger thus far is in the payment of the dividend.

capping the amount of tokens a holder can have toward any given endeavor will spread out the risk
toward all endeavors.  if those who give alms are limited to say, a $100 purchase on a 10K contract,
the most they would lose is a $100 - if they got a product for it, they will not lose at all - and
if they get a share on next round, they're awarded accordingly - like a discount on their product.
the real award comes through having given alms the round before the endeavor takes of beyond startup phase -
in which case, the tokens will hold great value relative to when they were bought...

so .... the tokens need to be able to listen for this wealth being passed from the future contract
and then execute wealth transfer from such unknown future contract to the token holder's wallet.

the tokens actually won't hold any wealth at all.  they are just like a certificate one would hang on the wall.


Angel token ids should make visual changes to the token that can help a human identify them quickly
 -as properly instituted angel tokens
 -of a unique endeavor
 -of a unique issue and on a date in time
 -of a particular cost
 -with an "angel's coefficient" in return
 -with a useful product


 REMEMBER: unstoppable decentralized and trust-less
